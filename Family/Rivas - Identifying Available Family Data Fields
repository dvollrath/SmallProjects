Household-Level Variables (Harmonized)
	•	HHTYPE (Household type/composition): A constructed variable describing the composition of a household (e.g. one-person, nuclear family, extended family, etc.). It is derived using relationship-to-head (RELATE) and family pointer variables (SPLOC, MOMLOC, POPLOC) and indicates configurations such as couples with/without children, lone parent, polygamous family, extended family, composite (with non-relatives), etc. Source Section: Household (constructed). Coverage: Available for all census samples that include full household information. Not available for “individual” samples that lack whole households (e.g. some survey subsets). Virtually all modern census samples provide HHTYPE; exceptions are a few historical or special samples where relationship detail was insufficient, which are coded as “Unclassifiable” (99) in HHTYPE.

	•	PERSONS (Household size): Indicates the number of person records in the household (household size). All individuals sharing the same household ID (SERIAL) are counted in PERSONS. This includes persons related or unrelated to the head, and even counts “0” in rare cases of vacant households in certain samples. Source Section: Household (technical). Coverage: Available and fully comparable across all IPUMS International samples. Every household record in every sample has a PERSONS value (with “0” for vacant units in a few datasets, which are usually omitted in extracts).

	•	UNREL (Number of unrelated individuals): A constructed count of how many persons in the household are notrelated to the household head. It tallies all members with RELATE codes in the “unrelated” category (e.g. lodgers, boarders, servants, etc.), top-coded at 9 for 9 or more. Researchers can use UNREL to consistently identify group quarters or non-family households by setting a threshold of unrelated members. Source Section: Household (constructed). Coverage: Available for most samples where RELATE is present. Generally present for all standard census samples; not applicable to individual-level samples. Allows cross-country comparison of group quarters by applying a uniform cutoff (e.g. households with ≥5 unrelated persons). No major country omissions – virtually all household-based censuses include this variable, except where relationship-to-head data are absent.

	•	NCOUPLES (Number of couples in household): A constructed count of married or cohabiting couples in the household. IPUMS identifies spouse pairs via the SPLOC pointer and counts the distinct pairs. Unmarried cohabiting partners are counted as couples where the data allow identification. Source Section: Household (constructed). Coverage: Available for nearly all household samples that have the necessary data to link spouses. Widely harmonized across countries (e.g. present in dozens of census samples globally). Not available in rare cases where entire households are not captured (or in individual-only samples). Virtually all modern census datasets include NCOUPLES; no significant country exclusions beyond those lacking spousal information.

	•	NMOTHERS / NFATHERS (Number of mothers/fathers in household): These constructed variables indicate how many individuals in the household are mothers and how many are fathers of at least one co-resident child. IPUMS uses the MOMLOC and POPLOC pointers to identify parent-child links; each mother (of any age child) present is counted in NMOTHERS, each father in NFATHERS. For example, a three-generation household could yield NMOTHERS=2 (a grandmother and a mother present). Source Section: Household (constructed). Coverage: Available in all standard household samples where pointer variables are constructed (virtually all censuses with relationship data). Not available in samples without full household structure. These are widely available across countries and years (no notable omissions aside from individual-level samples) – any sample with RELATE and age/sex detail for linking will have NMOTHERS/NFATHERS.

	•	NFAMS (Number of families in household): A constructed count of distinct family units within the household. IPUMS defines a “family” as any group of persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption; unrelated individuals each count as their own family. Thus, NFAMS=1 for a household consisting entirely of one extended family (even multi-generational), whereas a household with a domestic servant unrelated to the head would count as 2 families (the head’s family + the servant as a separate single-person family). Source Section: Household (constructed). Coverage: Available for all household-based samples with relationship data. Harmonized widely; most countries’ census samples include NFAMS. Exceptions: not applicable to individual-only samples or rare cases where relationship information is too limited to construct family units. Generally present in the same set of samples as HHTYPE and pointer variables (covering the vast majority of IPUMS International censuses).

	•	HEADLOC (Head’s location in household): Gives the person number (PERNUM) of the household head. This pointer essentially identifies which household member is designated as the head. In most cases the head is PERNUM=1, but HEADLOC ensures identification even if the head is listed later in the roster. In collective dwellings without a head, this may be 0 or absent. Source Section: Household (technical/constructed). Coverage: Available for all samples organized by household (nearly all IPUMS International censuses). Not relevant in samples without a defined head. A few group quarters cases or historical samples may lack a head designation, but otherwise every standard census sample has HEADLOC (except the individual-based samples where every record is essentially a head by default).
Person-Level Variables (Harmonized)
	•	RELATE (Relationship to head of household): Indicates each person’s reported relationship to the household head (sometimes called householder or reference person). Typical categories include head, spouse, child, child-in-law, grandchild, parent, other relative, and non-relative, with detail varying by country. This is a fundamental census question used to map family structure. Source Section: Person (core demographic). Coverage: Virtually universal – almost every IPUMS International sample has RELATE data for each person. It is available in all but a handful of cases (e.g. a few early censuses or special surveys). The vast majority of countries across all census years collected relationship-to-head. (All modern census samples and even most historical ones list RELATE; an “x” marks availability for essentially every sample in IPUMS, with rare exceptions like samples not organized by households.)

	•	MARST (Marital status): Records each person’s current marital status according to law or custom. Common codes are never married, married/in union, separated/divorced, widowed, etc. IPUMS harmonizes detailed categories (e.g. distinguishing consensual unions, spouse absent, etc. where possible). This variable helps identify married children, widowed heads, polygamous unions (in conjunction with other variables), etc. Source Section: Person (core demographic). Coverage: Available in all IPUMS International samples. Marital status is a standard census question in every country, so MARST is harmonized across virtually all countries and years. Minor differences in category detail exist, but there are no census samples without a MARST equivalent. (Even historical datasets and individual samples include at least basic marital status information.)

	•	MOMLOC / POPLOC (Mother’s and Father’s location in household): These are constructed “pointer” variables identifying each person’s probable mother and father within the same household. If the person’s mother is present, MOMLOC gives the person number of that mother (otherwise 0 if no mother co-resident). POPLOC likewise points to the co-resident father. These pointers enable linking children to parents and are inferred from RELATE, age, and other information following standardized algorithms. They identify biological, step, or adopted parents as available (with step/adoptive flagged separately by STEPMOM/STEPPOP). Source Section: Person (constructed family interrelationships). Coverage: Available for all census samples that include relationship-to-head and sufficient detail to infer parent links. IPUMS constructs MOMLOC/POPLOC for the vast majority of samples (covering essentially all countries and years in the dataset). Not available for samples lacking family structure data (e.g. some individual-level samples). A few very early censuses might not allow parent identification, but generally any sample with children and parent info has these pointers.

	•	SPLOC (Spouse’s location in household): A constructed pointer to a person’s probable spouse or partner in the same household. If the person is married or in a union and their spouse is present, SPLOC gives the person number of that spouse (0 if no spouse in household)microdata.worldbank.org. Unmarried cohabiting partners are also linked as spouses in most samples that identify consensual unions. SPLOC greatly simplifies locating married couples within the household data. Source Section: Person (constructed family interrelationships). Coverage: Available in all household-based samples with marital status and relationship data. IPUMS constructed SPLOC for nearly all samples (over 90 countries) where identifying couples is feasible. Absent only in cases where marital status or relationships were not recorded or inapplicable (again, not in the few individual-based samples). Essentially every modern census sample has SPLOC; no notable country omissions.

	•	STEPMOM / STEPPOP (Probable stepmother / stepfather indicators): These constructed variables flag cases where the mother or father identified by MOMLOC/POPLOC is likely not the person’s biological parentmicrodata.worldbank.org. Non-zero codes indicate reasons for classifying a mother/father as step/adoptive: for example, a child’s reported mother is too young/old to be biological, or the child was explicitly listed as stepchild, etc.microdata.worldbank.org. A value of 0 means the co-resident mother/father is probably biological (or no parent present)microdata.worldbank.org. These variables help refine parent-child relationships for fertility and kin analyses by identifying social (non-biological) parent links. Source Section: Person (constructed family interrelationships). Coverage: Available in all samples for which parent pointers (MOMLOC/POPLOC) are constructed and relevant detail (ages, explicit stepchild labels, etc.) exists to infer step/adoptive status. This covers most samples with MOMLOC/POPLOC (across all regions). In some datasets lacking the necessary detail, STEPMOM/STEPPOP may not be populated. Generally, wherever parent pointers exist, these step-parent flags are also provided, with codes standardized across countries.

	•	POLYMAL / POLY2ND (Polygamy pointers): These constructed indicators identify individuals in polygamous unions. POLYMAL flags men who have more than one wife linked via SPLOC. POLY2NDflags women who are a second or higher-order wife (i.e. a husband has at least two wives in the household, making this woman not the first in enumeration order). POLY2ND does not indicate the legal order of marriage, only that multiple wives are present and this wife is not listed first. These variables facilitate analysis of polygamous households by identifying the husbands with multiple spouses and the wives beyond the first. Source Section: Person (constructed family interrelationships). Coverage: Available in all samples that provide sufficient information to identify polygamous unions. Many countries (especially in Africa, Middle East, and some Asian samples) allow polygamy and have data to construct these variables. In samples where polygamy is not relevant or not reported, these variables either do not appear or are universally zero. (POLYMAL/POLY2ND are present for a wide range of countries and years – e.g. all samples that include polygamy in marital status or multiple spouses in households are covered – and are zero in cultures where monogamy is the norm.)

	•	NCHILD (Number of own children in household): For each person, NCHILD reports how many of their own (biological) children are present in the same household. This is a constructed count based on the MOMLOC/POPLOC links – essentially counting how many persons identify this individual as their mother or fatherdata.as-rcp.org. For example, if a woman has two of her children living in the household, her NCHILD=2. (Step- and adopted children are included as “own” children in this context if they are linked via the pointers.) Source Section: Person (constructed family interrelationships). Coverage: Available for all samples with parent pointer variables. This covers most IPUMS International samples, since nearly all have the data to identify parent-child linksdata.as-rcp.org. A few samples that lack RELATE or where pointers could not be constructed will not have NCHILD. By and large, any country/year where family interrelationships are built will include NCHILD (no major country exclusions). Researchers can thus use NCHILD across countries to identify, for instance, which adults are co-resident with children (NCHILD > 0) versus childless in the household.

	•	FAMUNIT (Family unit membership code): Indicates to which family within a household the person belongs. All persons related to the household head are assigned to the primary family (code 1). If there is a second unrelated family or individual in the household, they get code 2, and so on. In other words, FAMUNIT tags each person with a family group number within the household. It treats any group of related persons as one unit, and unrelated single individuals as their own unit. (This is different from subfamilies – FAMUNIT is an IPUMS construct for broad family groups related to the head.) Source Section: Person (constructed, household context). Coverage: Available in all samples where relationship and pointers exist to determine family groupings. Nearly all multi-person household samples have FAMUNIT. No variable in individual-based samples. In practically every country’s census data, all persons get a FAMUNIT code (usually “1” for the main family; additional codes if any secondary family units present). There are no notable country omissions; FAMUNIT is widely applicable across time and place for delineating multiple-family households.

	•	FAMSIZE (Size of own family unit): Reports the number of persons in the individual’s own family unit within the household (including the person themself). Essentially, for each person, FAMSIZE counts how many people share their FAMUNIT code. For members of the primary family, it would be the total size of that family; for an unrelated individual, FAMSIZE=1. It includes all relatives by blood, marriage, or adoption of that person in the household. For example, in a household with a head, spouse, 3 children, and a boarder, the head, spouse, and children each have FAMSIZE=5 (their family has 5 members), while the boarder has FAMSIZE=1. Source Section: Person (constructed). Coverage: Available in the same samples as FAMUNIT (since it’s derived from FAMUNIT and pointers). Thus, virtually all household-based samples have FAMSIZE. No major exclusions by country/year aside from those without family interrelationship data. It is harmonized across countries, allowing comparison of family unit sizes within households everywhere RELATE and pointer variables are present.

	•	SUBFREL / SUBFNUM (Subfamily relationship and number): Some samples include the concept of subfamilies, typically a nuclear family living within a larger household (e.g. a married child and their spouse/children living with the head). SUBFNUM gives the subfamily number to which a person belongs (1 = primary family, 2 = second subfamily, etc.), as defined in the original census data. SUBFREL describes the person’s relationship to the head of that subfamily (e.g. subfamily head, subfamily spouse, child of subfamily head) – distinct from their RELATE to the household head. These variables essentially capture the census bureau’s identification of secondary family nuclei inside the household. For instance, a household head’s married daughter and son-in-law might be marked as a second family (SUBFNUM=2), with the daughter coded as “head” of that subfamily and her husband as “spouse” in SUBFREL. Source Section: Person (partly harmonized, based on source data). Coverage: Important: SUBFREL and SUBFNUM are not available for all countries – only those censuses that explicitly recorded subfamilies or family nuclei. They appear in a subset of samples (e.g., many Latin American and some European censuses in certain years, such as Brazil 1960–2000 except 2010, Ireland mid-20th century, etc., where subfamilies were identified). In those samples, these variables are harmonized to a degree, but comparability issues exist since definitions differed. Samples that did not capture subfamilies simply have no SUBFREL/SUBFNUM. Researchers should note that these variables are absent in most recent censuses; they are primarily found in older datasets or specific countries that used “subfamily” concepts. IPUMS provides them when available from the source, but they are not universal. (Where present, they can be used alongside FAMUNIT to reconstruct original family nuclei within extended households.)
Note: Using the above variables in combination enables analysis of complex family structures. For example, one can identify co-resident married children with parents by finding individuals who are a child of the head (RELATE) and are married (MARST), or by detecting a child-in-law present (which implies a married child of the head). The harmonized IPUMS pointers and family composition variables make it possible to reconstruct multi-generational households (e.g. count generations by checking if grandchildren and parents of head are present) and other nuanced structures across diverse census samples.
